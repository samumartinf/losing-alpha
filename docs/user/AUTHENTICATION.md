## Signing In

To access protected features of LosingAlpha, you need to sign in with your username and password.

1. Click the "Sign In" button in the top-right corner of the navigation bar
2. Enter your username and password in the login form
3. Click "Sign In" to authenticate

If your credentials are correct, you'll be automatically redirected to the dashboard.

## Signing Out

To sign out of your account:

1. Click the "Sign Out" button in the top-right corner of the navigation bar

## Protected Content

Most areas of the LosingAlpha platform require authentication. If you try to access protected content without signing in, you'll be automatically redirected to the login page.

Protected areas include:
- Dashboard (/demo)
- Market data pages
- Portfolio management
- Account settings

Public areas that don't require authentication:
- Login page
- Registration page
- Terms of service
- Privacy policy

## Session Management

LosingAlpha uses secure session management to keep you signed in:

- Your session remains active for 30 days from your last activity
- Sessions automatically refresh as you use the application
- If you don't use the application for 30 days, you'll need to sign in again
- You can sign out manually to end your session immediately

## Troubleshooting

**I can't sign in**
- Make sure you're using the correct username and password
- Check if Caps Lock is enabled
- Clear your browser cookies and try again

**I was unexpectedly signed out**
- Your session may have expired after 30 days of inactivity
- Your browser cookies may have been cleared
- You may have signed in from another device

**I'm redirected to login when clicking certain links**
- The page you're trying to access requires authentication
- Your session may have expired
- Try signing in again
